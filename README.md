_Story Time !_ is a project conceived during my second year in my engineering school [Telecom Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/). It aimed to help french people to progress in English.

## Context

This project aims to provide a simple interface and mechanism to help people of all levels to train themselves in several aspects of
the English language.

### How does it works ?

üìù Note: _No session or account is required, however everything is localy stored._

_Story Time !_ is a small hub for small stories written by the users. Everyone can export, share and import stories of others.

A story consists of a `.story` file (basicly JSON) and can be played inside the plateform. When played, the user will be asked
to find the answer of each questions until the end.

On failure, he will have the opportunity to see the correct answer he missed.

One can use this project to create small tests to train themselves for small lessons waiting for an evaluation or just to challenge
themselves (or any other usage that suits you !)
